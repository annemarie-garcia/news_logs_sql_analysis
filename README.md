# news_logs_sql_analysis
A Udacity Project to build a reporting tool that sumarises data from a large database.

This project runs and displays an output in the command line git bash, which answers the following three questions -

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

The output is formatted in a way that can be undestood by anyone who needs to know about the site's user activity. A example output folder is attatched showing a text file and an image of the output in the command line.

The PostgreSQL database is run on a Linux-based virtual machine, using Vagrant and VirtualBox to install and manage the VM.
